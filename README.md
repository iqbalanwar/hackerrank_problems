## Extra Problems
Note: These problems I found/heard, and decided to do. I don't have a link to the online resource from which I got these.
1) *CountRepeats:* Given an array that may or may not contain repeated numbers, and can contain negative and positive numbers, print the number of repeats for each number.
  - Both the brute force and hashmap solution can be found in the CountRepeats/src directory
